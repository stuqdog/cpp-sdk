These examples assume that the Viam C++ SDK has been built and
installed. If you have not yet done so, please visit the root of the
tree and read the build instructions, then install the SDK.

- For an example project showing how to consume an installed
  `viam-cpp-sdk` with CMake's `find_package`, see
  `cmake/CMakeLists.txt`.

- For an example project showing how to consume an installed
  `viam-cpp-sdk` via its `pkg-config` setup, see
